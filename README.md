# Python-Project-14-Snake-Game-Text-based-
a simple text-based version of the classic Snake game where the player controls the snake's movement to collect food.

Objectives:
1. Simulate the movement of the snake within a grid.
2. Allow the snake to grow each time it collects food.
3. End the game if the snake runs into itself or the grid's boundary.
